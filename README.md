## Building the project
From the project root folder (where `template.yml` is located),
use SAM CLI to build the project:
```bash
$ sam build

## Testing locally with the SAM CLI
From the project root folder (where `template.yml` is located),
use SAM CLI to deploy the project on `localhost:6000`:

```bash

```

## Deploying to AWS Lambda and API Gateway
